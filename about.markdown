In this project, the KJAAAnalytics team has taken the challenge of assisting EPFL student Bob in planning a global, beer-centered trip through data-driven insights. Using geospatial and semantic analysis, we’ll map global beer preferences to help Bob make informed choices. We’ll analyze beer descriptions by country through natural language processing to uncover unique linguistic patterns and local preferences, enabling Bob to order like a connoisseur. Seasonal variations in beer ratings will be examined to reveal shifts in taste preferences, guiding Bob’s choices based on time of year. Additionally, a geospatial analysis of beer ratings by U.S. climate zones will identify popular styles in various climates, optimizing Bob’s selections for different regions. Finally, upon his return to EPFL, we’ll leverage these findings to recommend seasonal beer selections for Satellite, EPFL’s student bar, aligned with Swiss climate patterns. 

## Interactive journey

This interactive website has been designed to provide a seamingless user experience through Bob's journey. Using the navigation buttons, the navigation sidebar or even the above timeline icons (clickable!), find out some of Bob's discoveries. Deepen into Bob's thoughts by navigating throught alternating funfacts and analysis, giving the user the best experience as possible!
