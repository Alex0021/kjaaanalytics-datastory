On his way to Belgium, Bob recognizes a student from his ADA class, and by a stroke of luck, this new friend is Belgian! They discuss the beer festival. Bob’s new friend mentions that they are only 3 beers that were rated by professionals for the past 20 years! They are the : 
- Delirium Nocturnum
- Delirium Tremens
- Trappistes Rochefort 10

Overall, the ratings seem fairly consistent over the years and the Trappistes Rochefort 10 beer style is always the most appreciated!  Let’s let Bob enjoy the wonders of his festival and we’ll move on to the next analysis to learn about the seasonality of beer preferences!
