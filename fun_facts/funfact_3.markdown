On his flight to Canada, Bob watches a documentary about local breweries and begins to wonder how the beer scene in Canada compares to Belgium, where he’s tried some of the finest brews. Armed with these pie charts, Bob can dive into the beer styles he loved in Belgium and determine how they measure up in Canada. The charts will show him which beer styles are popular in Canada. Whether retrying a classic Belgian know beer or discovering a Canadian one, these charts will guide Bob through a fun, flavorful journey across both countries.

But the adventure doesn’t stop at just comparing styles—Bob will soon dive deeper into the Canadian beer ratings.
