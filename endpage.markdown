In England first, he learnt what vocabulary the real beer connoisseurs use to describe different beer style. Thanks to this new knowledge, he travelled to Belgium where he learnt about the seasonality of beer preferences. He discovered that some beers are all-around favorites in Belgium, regardless of the season! In Canada, he dove deep into the local culture by investigating the most polarizing beers. He concluded that many factors could influence whether a beer is loved by some and hated by others! This lead him to wondering if the climate could have an influence as well. He travelled to the USA, where this time, he is interested in the link between popular beers and climate. Thanks to the classification of each state in a *typical climate* using a clustering algorithm, he could unveil general trends.

The time has now come for Bob to go home and share his insights with his favorite bar, *Satellite* of course! As he learned that it was important, he wants to recommend beer styles, that are in accordance with Lausanne‚Äôs climate. Doing a final analysis in the plane, he looks at Switzerland‚Äôs climate and classifies it using the American climate to assign each point to an existing cluster. By spotting Lausanne on the map, he checks the cluster label, and goes back to his notes to find the three best-rated beer styles in this *typical climate*. Get ready to discover his final recommendations!
