Bob is now at the beer festival that always occurs in early September.  Nevertheless it is pouring rain, and while enjoying his beer, Bob wonders how the seasons affect beer preferences. Surely people must enjoy different type of beers in summer than in winter! 

To satisfy Bob’s curiosity, we look at the average rating of each beer style during different seasons, focusing on the ratings coming from belgian user. The seasons are pretty uniform across Belgium, so it makes sense to compare seasonal preferences there. Additionally, seasonal changes in climate are pretty strong here! Indeed falls and winters are typically cold and rainy, whereas springs and summers can get hot and sunny. To understand seasonal beer style preferences, reviews were grouped by season and by beer style, and ratings aggregated via averaging. Then, the beer styles were ranked per season, and the five best-rated styles are presented in the next graph.

Bob’s hypothesis was partly correct. Indeed, some styles seem to have more succes in some months than in others. 

This is the case for _American Ales_ (_Brown_, _Amber_, _Red_ and _Black_), which are best-rated in Fall and Winter. Those beer styles usually display deep caramel and chocolate flavor profiles, and medium to high bitterness. In summer, the *Faro* style, which comes from Brussel is popular mainly in spring and summer. *Faro* in made from *Lambic* beer, by adding additional brown sugar. The two *Lambic* styles are also best-rated in spring, which hints at distinct taste preferences during this season. This style is also known for its cidery aftertaste.

Over the year, cidery style like *Lambic* and *Faro* or lighter beers such as *Mailbock* seemed to be preferred in spring, whereas deep and bitter beers, like the *American Ales*, are best-rated in fall and winter

Nevertheless some styles, such as *Gueuze* seem to be year-round staples for Belgians. This local beer style is highly carbonated and made from *Lambic* beers. *Eisbock* as well are enjoyed both in winter and in summer, despite its malty flavor ans strong alcohol content.
Overall, Bob’s intuition was partly right! He is quite happy about this insight into seasonal preferences, and is ready to share it to fellow beer-enthusiats during the beer festival. 

He is now eager to explore how beer preferences shift in a different cultural and geographical context. With its unique regional styles, Canada offers the perfect oppurtunity to compare and contrast brewing traditions.
