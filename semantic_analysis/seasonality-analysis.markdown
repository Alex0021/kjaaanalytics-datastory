Bob is now at the beer festival that always occurs in early September.  It is pouring rain, nevertheless, Bob is enjoying his beer. He wonders how the seasons affect beer preferences. Surely people must enjoy different types of beers in summer than in winter! 

To satisfy Bob’s curiosity, we look at the average rating of each beer style during different seasons, focusing on the ratings coming from Belgian users. The seasons are pretty uniform across Belgium, so it makes sense to compare seasonal preferences there. Additionally, seasonal climate changes are pretty strong here! Indeed Falls and Winters are typically cold and rainy, whereas Springs and Summers can get hot and sunny. To understand seasonal beer style preferences, reviews were grouped by season and by beer style, and ratings were aggregated via averaging. Then, the beer styles were ranked per season, and the five best-rated styles were presented in the next graph.

Bob’s hypothesis was partly correct. Indeed, some styles seem to have more success in some months than in others. 

This is the case for *American Ales (Brown, Amber, Red,* and *Black)*, which are best-rated in Fall and Winter. Those beer styles usually display deep caramel and chocolate flavor profiles, and medium to high bitterness. In summer, the *Faro* style, which comes from Brussels is popular mainly in spring and summer. *Faro* is made from *Lambic* beer, by adding additional brown sugar. The two *Lambic* styles are also best-rated in spring, which hints at distinct taste preferences during this season. This style is also known for its cidery aftertaste.

Over the year, cidery styles like *Lambic* and *Faro* or lighter beers such as *Mailbock* seemed to be preferred in spring, whereas deep and bitter beers, like the *American Ales*, are best rated in fall and winter. Nevertheless, some styles, such as *Gueuze* seem to be year-round staples for Belgians. This local beer style is highly carbonated and made from *Lambic* beers. *Eisbock* as well is enjoyed both in winter and in summer, despite its malty flavor and strong alcohol content. Overall, Bob’s intuition was partly right! He is quite happy about this insight into seasonal preferences and is ready to share it with fellow beer enthusiasts during the beer festival. 

He is now eager to explore how beer preferences shift in a different cultural and geographical context. With its unique regional styles, Canada offers the perfect opportunity to compare and contrast brewing traditions.
